    <h2>Online Bus Management System</h2>
    <ul class="project">
        <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Description:</b>The main objective this project is to developing a GUI based Automated
            system, which will cover all the information related to the Bus Timings,Bus
            Bookings,Customer Information which is used in our daily life. To know the facts and
            understanding the problem in detail, System Analysis is carried out. This activity
            includes programming, testing and integration.
            </li><br>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Responsibilities:</b>Worked as an active member in a group of 2 people and contributed in
            programming and testing process.

    <h2>Snapchat Review Analysis</h2>
    <ul class="project">
        <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Description:</b>The aim of snapchat review analysis is to provide insight into the public’s opinions, emotions and feelings towards a particular event.
            The objective is to extract and analyze the sentiments,reviews and emotions expressed in snaps on the snapchat.It is the process of using natural language processing techniques to extract and analyze the sentiment, opinion, and emotions expressed in Snaps.
            Sentiment analysis  is a  type  of study which  enables  the researchers or product developers to analyze users comments, opinions or expressions towards certain products or services .
            In this We are going to be looking at the sentiments, in other words, opinion or belief, of all 10k reviews and see if each review is Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

    <h2>Clap Control Car</h2>
    <ul class="project">
        <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Description:</b>This Project is about how Clap Control Car will helpful for children.
            Clap Control Car based on Arduino aims to control the car using sound sensor.
            The sensor and L289D motor driver are connected to the Arduino to transmit data.
            The sound sensor senses our clap sounds and shows where to move whether it is forward,backward,left or right.
            Nowadays children are playing with remote control cars.
            By using remote control cars they are becoming lazy and it is wastage of amount.
            To overcome this we built a car that is controlled by clap sounds of our hands.
            It will be very useful for children.</li><br>
